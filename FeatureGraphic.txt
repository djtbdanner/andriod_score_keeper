Score Keeper is a simple to use, fun and free!
It contains no adds and no in app purchaces - no charge for anything.

It was designed for parents to keep score at their kiddo's sports activities.

 * Just tip your phone to the side that scores to keep score.
 * Score can also be tracked via screen.
 * You can choose the points per goal for different activities.
 * You can choose your team color.
 * The app has a shake feature for those parents that get too excited at the game. 
   This prevents scores from increasing (most of the time) when you wave or cheer.
 
 This app was written, for the most part, so I could become familiar with
 Android Developement - thus the free app.
 
                     I hope you enjoy Score Keeper!
                     I had fun writing it (and showing the kids).
