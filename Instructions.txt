Keep track of team points by tilting your phone to the left or right.

You can choose the number of points per goal via menu (i.e. 2 points for basket ball goal). The number of points per goal will register with a left or right tilt or left or right swipe (left swipe will remove mistakes). Swiping up or down always registers one point only so you can keep track of the single point goals.

You can choose the team colors for each side via menu.

You can swap team sides at half time by swiping fully from left to right or right to left.

You can enter team names with a long click on the menu.

You can choose the reset points start point (i.e. some volleyball games start at 4 points) via the menu.

You can set the win parameters via the menu (i.e. volleyball win is 25 with a 2 point spread required). Note that once a team has won the scoring will no longer increase, however if you or the device add some points incorrectly, they can be rolled back with a swipe down on the score.

You can enable a game saving feature for a day via the menu. The game save feature will save the game scores to the download folder on yourdevice and it can be opened with a spreadsheet program. The save to file feature, when enabled, will only be enabled for the day. Once the day is over the feature will be disabled unless you re-enable it.

Your team colors, score, points per goal, team names and reset start point are stored with every change so the app can be shut down or minimized at any time there is a pause in the game. Your colors and score will be stored and waiting for you when the game starts back up.

Hope you have fun with Score Keeper!
